## 💡 IMPORTANT NOTES

### Design Principles
- **$100 Bet Standard**: Every element should pass "Would you bet $100 this impresses top UK recruiters?"
- **Technical Excellence**: No fluff, all claims backed by actual projects
- **Professional Tone**: Confident but not arrogant, technical but accessible
- **UK Market Focus**: Salary ranges in £, UK companies, UK trends

### Color Scheme Consistency
- **Main Accent**: #64ffda (teal/mint) - used in project reports
- **Dark Mode BG**: #000000 (pitch black)
- **Light Text**: #FFFFFF or var(--text-primary)
- **Secondary Text**: var(--text-secondary)
- **NO Navy Blue (#1E3A8A) in dark mode** - fixed via CSS overrides

### File Naming Conventions
- HTML files: lowercase-with-dashes.html
- Markdown files: UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.md (for documentation)
- Image files: descriptive-name.jpg/png
- CSS/JS: style.css, script.js

### Gemini Usage Best Practices
- Always use `--yolo` flag for automatic approval
- Provide full context (@files, @CLAUDE.md, @resume)
- Use $100 confidence bet framing
- Specify UK market requirements
- Request Medium-style professional formatting
- Run multiple tasks in parallel when possible
