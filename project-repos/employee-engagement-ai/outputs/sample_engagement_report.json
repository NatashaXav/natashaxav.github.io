  "executive_summary": "Overall Sentiment: 58% Positive, 22% Neutral, 20% Negative. This represents a slight improvement from last year's 54% positive. The strongest areas of satisfaction are Work-Life Balance and Company Culture, with employees consistently praising the flexible work policies and inclusive team environment. Key concerns center on Career Growth & Development (cited by 45% of negative comments) and Compensation & Benefits (30% of negative comments). Engineering department shows notably lower satisfaction in Career Growth, while Marketing and Sales teams report higher overall engagement. Recommended actions: (1) Launch structured career development pathways with clear progression timelines, (2) Review compensation benchmarking and conduct equity analysis, (3) Increase mentorship and cross-functional project opportunities.",
