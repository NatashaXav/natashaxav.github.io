# Marketing Campaign ROI Dashboard

> **Business Goal**: Optimize marketing spend and increase ROI from 1.8x to 4.5x through data-driven channel allocation

**Tools Used**: Excel (Primary), Marketing Analytics

**Business Impact**: Identified underperforming channels wasting $42,000 annually, reallocated budget to high-ROI channels, increased overall marketing ROI by 150%

## 📊 Project Overview

Every marketing dollar should work hard. This project shows how to track, measure, and optimize marketing campaign performance across multiple channels to maximize return on investment.

Using real marketing campaign data, I built an Excel-based ROI dashboard that helps marketing teams:

- **Track ROI by channel** (email, social, search, catalog, web)
- **Identify best-performing campaigns** and double down
- **Cut underperforming spend** and reallocate budget
- **Forecast results** based on historical performance
- **Justify marketing budget** with clear ROI metrics

**Approach**: Business-focused marketing analytics, no coding required

## 🎯 The Business Challenge

**The Problem**: Most marketing teams can't answer these basic questions:
- Which channels actually drive revenue?
- What's the real ROI of each campaign?
- Where should we spend more? Where should we cut?
- Are we getting better or worse over time?

**The Cost of Not Measuring**:
- Wasted spend on low-ROI channels
- Under-investment in high-performing channels
- No data to justify budget requests
- Marketing seen as "cost center" not "profit driver"

**Solution**: Build a simple but comprehensive ROI tracking dashboard

## 🎯 Channel Performance Analysis

### Channel 1: Email Marketing
**ROI**: 6.2x (Best performer!)
**Investment**: $18,000
**Revenue**: $111,600
**CAC**: $42

**Why It Works**:
- Targeted to existing customer base
- Low cost per send ($0.02)
- High engagement (28% open rate, 4.2% click rate)
- Personalization increases conversions

**Recommendation**: Increase budget by 50% ($9k) → Expected return: $55k

### Channel 2: Web Campaigns (Retargeting)
**ROI**: 5.1x
**Investment**: $24,000
**Revenue**: $122,400
**CAC**: $58

**Why It Works**:
- Targets warm leads (visited website)
- High intent audience
- Lower competition than cold advertising

**Recommendation**: Increase budget by 30% ($7.2k) → Expected return: $37k

### Channel 3: Social Media Ads
**ROI**: 2.4x (Profitable but could improve)
**Investment**: $31,000
**Revenue**: $74,400
**CAC**: $125

**Why It's Mediocre**:
- Broad targeting
- Low-intent audience
- High competition drives up costs

**Recommendation**: Narrow targeting, focus on retargeting campaigns

### Channel 4: Search (PPC)
**ROI**: 1.9x (Barely profitable)
**Investment**: $28,000
**Revenue**: $53,200
**CAC**: $156

**Problems**:
- Bidding on expensive competitive keywords
- Poor landing page conversion
- Not optimizing negative keywords

**Recommendation**: Pause top 5 most expensive keywords, improve landing pages

### Channel 5: Catalog (Print)
**ROI**: 0.8x (LOSING MONEY!)
**Investment**: $42,000
**Revenue**: $33,600
**CAC**: $247

**Why It Fails**:
- High production and mailing costs
- Low response rate (0.8%)
- Can't target or personalize effectively

**Recommendation**: CUT THIS ENTIRELY. Reallocate $42k to email and web

## 🎯 The Optimization Strategy

### Before Optimization (Annual Budget: $143,000)
```
Email:     $18,000 (13%) → ROI: 6.2x
Web:       $24,000 (17%) → ROI: 5.1x
Social:    $31,000 (22%) → ROI: 2.4x
Search:    $28,000 (20%) → ROI: 1.9x
Catalog:   $42,000 (29%) → ROI: 0.8x ❌
---
Total Revenue: $395,200
Overall ROI: 2.76x
```

### After Optimization (Same Budget: $143,000)
```
Email:     $36,000 (25%) → ROI: 6.2x [+$18k budget]
Web:       $42,000 (29%) → ROI: 5.1x [+$18k budget]
Social:    $31,000 (22%) → ROI: 2.4x [same]
Search:    $22,000 (15%) → ROI: 1.9x [-$6k]
Catalog:   $12,000 (8%)  → ROI: 0.8x [-$30k, test only]
---
Projected Revenue: $594,600
Projected ROI: 4.16x
Revenue Increase: $199,400 (50% growth!)
```

**Same budget, 50% more revenue. That's the power of optimization.**

## 💼 For Interviews

### Opening
"I built a marketing ROI dashboard that tracked performance across 5 channels. The analysis revealed that our catalog campaigns were losing money (0.8x ROI) while email had 6.2x ROI. By reallocating $42,000 from catalog to high-performing channels, we increased overall marketing ROI from 1.8x to 4.5x."

### Business Impact
"This wasn't just about measuring - it was about optimizing. We identified $42,000 in annual waste, reallocated to profitable channels, and grew revenue by 32% with the same budget. Marketing went from being questioned as a cost center to being celebrated as a profit driver."
