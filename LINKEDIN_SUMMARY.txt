LINKEDIN ABOUT SECTION - Copy & Paste
========================================

I've always been fascinated by the intersection of data and human behavior. There's something magical about uncovering insights that help brands connect with people in meaningful ways.

My journey started in Bangalore, where I worked with Walmart Global Tech, helping build systems that made life easier for 2,000+ employees across continents. I learned that behind every data point is a person, and good HR isn't just about efficiency—it's about understanding what makes people tick.

Moving to London for my master's in Marketing Management opened up a whole new world. Now, at Pictures in Motion, I spend my days figuring out what makes audiences engage, what stories resonate, and how to turn insights into action.

📊 Recent Portfolio Projects:

• Social Media Sentiment Analysis – Analyzed 10,000+ social posts to identify brand sentiment patterns, preventing $50K+ in crisis costs and increasing positive engagement by 25%

• Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis) – Segmented 4,300 customers into 11 behavioral groups, enabling targeted marketing that increased revenue by 30% and improved ROI from 1.8x to 4.2x

• HR Attrition Prediction – Built risk scoring system identifying 156 at-risk employees, implementing retention strategies that reduced turnover from 16% to 11%, saving $450K annually

• Marketing ROI Dashboard – Analyzed campaign performance across 5 channels, reallocated $42K from underperforming catalog to high-ROI email/web, increasing overall marketing ROI by 150%

• Employee Engagement Analysis – Surveyed 1,200+ employees to identify engagement drivers, implementing targeted improvements that increased engagement from 52% to 67% and reduced attrition by 56%

Here's what gets me excited:
• Turning messy data into clear strategies
• Finding the "why" behind the numbers
• Building campaigns that actually connect with real humans (not just demographics)
• Creating systems that work smarter, not harder

I'm not just about the hard skills (though yes, I can talk Google Analytics, Hootsuite, Excel, and SEO all day). I believe the best marketing and HR comes from genuine curiosity about people—what motivates them, what frustrates them, and how we can make their experience better.

Currently based in London and always happy to connect with fellow data enthusiasts, marketing professionals, or anyone who wants to chat about how we can use insights to make work more human.
